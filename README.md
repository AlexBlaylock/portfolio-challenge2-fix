# portfolio-challenge2-fix
 This project was focused on using CSS properties, in particular a lot of use of flex-box. 

I made this with the intention of being a mock up portfolio that can showcase my abilities in CSS.

Having to start from 0 code rather than refactoriong code meant that I had a lot more work cut out for me. A lot of my starting issues were just knowing where to start. 

I had a lot of struggles with this project. Knowing how to format my page, where to place things, and even things like what color palette should I use. I had to use A LOT of trial and error when it came to the placement of my images and text. What ended up happening is that I have been struggling to fill the deadspace for my About Me section.

This current repo that you are seeing is also a fresh repo that I made due to deployment issues with my last one. This is why there are low commits to this repo.

I used a lot of outside resources, some referenced in my code but here are some linked in my README for more citing:

https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp 
https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_container.asp

Overall I think that this challenge went like a 7/10 for me, I had a lot of struggles with using CSS. I do believe I am a lot weaker at CSS then I am at HTML, and I think this challenge reflects that.

[SUBMISSION 2]Upon review I am bad at reading acceptance criteria. Should be fixed now.
